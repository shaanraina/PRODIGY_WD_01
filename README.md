It is an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu have a fixed position and be visible on all pages. I Have used HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity, such as changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over.

Explanation:

HTML: A logo is added inside the navbar for a more professional look. The rest of the structure remains the same.

CSS:The #navbar styles are enhanced with a semi-transparent background and box-shadow for depth.
A .scrolled class is added to change the background and padding when the user scrolls.
The container class is used to align the logo and menu items properly.
Smooth transitions are added for hover effects on the links, and the links scale up slightly on hover.

JavaScript: The scrolled class is toggled based on the scroll position to change the navbar's style dynamically.
This implementation provides a more visually appealing and interactive navigation menu that enhances user experience.
